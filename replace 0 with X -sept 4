/*I've used a DFS approach to point out the regions of 'O' characters that were not completely 'X' surrounded.

To identify these regions, I have checked all the grid borders. If I encounter any 'O' character along the border, it indicates that the connected 'O' characters within this region is not entirely enclosed by 'X'. So, I label such 'O' characters as 'N'.
At last, I identify the 'O' characters that are entirely surrounded, and I replace them with 'X' and change 'N' to 'O' back.
The steps involved in implementing this:

I define a dx and dy array to represent the four possible directions: up, down, left, and right.
I create two helper functions:
isValid checks if a given cell is within the bounds of the matrix.
isBoundary checks if a given cell is on the boundary of the matrix.
I use a recursive function setNotClosed to mark all connected 'O' characters as 'N' if they are not closed (not surrounded by 'X').
In the fill function, I iterate through the entire matrix and whenever I encounter an 'O' on the boundary, I call setNotClosed to mark all connected 'O' characters as 'N'.
Finally, I iterate through the entire matrix again and change 'O' to 'X' and 'N' back to 'O' to complete the transformation.
